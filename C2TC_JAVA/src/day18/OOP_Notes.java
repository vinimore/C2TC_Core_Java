	 * In Java, Encapsulation can be implemented with help of classes, nested classes & packages.
	 * e.g. In one bag we carry Grossary and Dairy items
	 * 
	 * Inheritance:
	 * is concept that acquired the properties from one class to another class
	 * 
	 * Single : Simple form, Only one parent and one child class
	 * Multilevel : implemented multilevel
	 * Hierarchical : only one Base/ Parent class & Multipe Derived/ Child class
	 * 
	 * Polymorphism:
	 * One to Many
	 * 
	 * Method Overloading: 
	 * Same name-->different parameters or different data types or both
	 * 
	 * Method Overriding: 
	 * Same name, same parameters, same data types-->different function or implimentation
